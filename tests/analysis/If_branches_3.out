  BRANCH DISAGREEMENT  -------------------------------------------------------

  Both branches of an if-expression must return the same type. The first branch
  returned the type:

    ()

    : If_branches_3
  3 |     "abc";
    |          ^

  But the second branch returned the type:

    Str

    : If_branches_3
  5 |     "def"
    |     ^^^^^
