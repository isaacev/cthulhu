  TYPE MISMATCH  -------------------------------------------------------------

  The statement was marked as having the type `Int`:

    : generic_2
  7 |   let x: Int = id("abc");
    |          ^^^

  But the expression has the type `Str`:

    : generic_2
  7 |   let x: Int = id("abc");
    |                ^^^^^^^^^
