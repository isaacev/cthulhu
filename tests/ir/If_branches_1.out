  BRANCH DISAGREEMENT  -------------------------------------------------------

  Both branches of an if-expression must return the same type. The first branch
  returned the type:

    Str

    : If_branches_1
  5 |     "is a string"
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  But the second branch returned the type:

    Int

    : If_branches_1
  7 |     123
    |     ^^^
